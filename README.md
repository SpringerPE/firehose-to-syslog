# Event documentation

See the [dropsonde protocol documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde-protocol/tree/master/events) for details on what data is sent as part of each event.

# Caching
We use [boltdb](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) for caching application name, org and space name.

We have 3 caching strategies:
* Pull all application data on start.
* Pull application data if not cached yet.
* Pull all application data every "cc-pull-time".
